# Structural breaks in predictive modelling

[Download pdf](./pdfs/seminar_structural_breaks_in_predictive_modelling.pdf)

## Introduction

As part of a seminar in [applications of machine learning](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%C3%98kk08411u/2020-2021), I devised a method to detect structural breaks in prediction or classification problems
with repeated cross sections. In @fig-structuralbreaks, I display the central idea of how structural breaks between time-periods causes a change in the distribution of the mean squared error between time-periods.

## Abstract 

A novel method to detect structural breaks in classification or prediction problems with repeated
cross sections is proposed. The theoretical foundation is presented and the power and robustness
of the method in a specific use case is showcased with a simulation study. The method utilizes
that the generalization error of a model is an IID sample from a distribution which can only
change between periods if the data generating process changes. Utilizing holdout data in each
period, any changes in performance can then be attributed to a structural break in the data.
This is tested utilizing tests for equality of means between the samples.

# The effect of education on health
[Download pdf](./pdfs/seminar_the_effect_of_education_on_health.pdf)

## Introduction

As part of a seminar in [empirical health economics](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%c3%98kk08325u/2021-2022), I examined the effect of education on late-life depressive symptoms with a focus on heterogeneity across socio-economic status. I use instrumental variables with compulsory schooling reforms to obtain exogenous variation across european countries, principal component analysis to create a continuous measure of socio-economic status and causal forests to estimate conditional local average treatment effects. As the conditional local average treatment effects vary across countries and other covariates and are generally associated with wide confidence intervals, the main conclusion is that further research is needed before conclusions about the influence of education on late-life depressive symptoms can be made. The main finding can be seen in @fig-empiricalhealth, where the wide confidence almost always include a null effect.

## Abstract

I provide new evidence on the causal effect of education on health using compulsory schooling
reforms to obtain exogenous identification of education. I estimate the local average treatment
effect to be a reduction in depressive symptoms by 0.11 per extra year of education induced
by the schooling reforms, but the effect is not statistically significant. I show that there
exists a lot of heterogeneity in the effect sizes, with the most robust finding being that women
benefit most from additional education, but also observe indications that people with lower socioeconomic
status also benefit more. However, all of the findings are associated with wide confidence
intervals. The large amounts of heterogeneity, which varies across countries and other covariates,
indicate that one should be wary of extrapolating findings in the literature to new settings
without further research.
