I am a Ph.D. fellow at the [Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science](https://sodas.ku.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen. My goal is to make the world a more data-driven place, both using predictive machine learning and by doing causal inference using quasi-experimental methods.

My current research focuses on how to efficiently utilize data about the Danish youth to predict later life events.


I'm part of the [Nation-scale social networks](https://sodas.ku.dk/projects/nation-scale-social-networks/) project, which is a joint collaboration between the University of Copenhagen, Technical University of Denmark and Statistics Denmark.
